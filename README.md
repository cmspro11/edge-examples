## Setup 

n order to work with this repository you may install some tools beforehand. These will help you with the examples and when you make changes to the source code.
There are 3 main helpers that you will need. 

* Node.js - Javascript for cour command line
* Bower - Helps you find and install nice Javascript packages for your edge compositions
* Grunt - Helps you build and maintain concise and error free javascript files. Grunt does all the "Grunt work"

### node.js 

This is Javascript for your command line aka "Terminal". This is the plattform all other tools are build on.

Wikipedia says: 

> Node.js is a software platform for scalable server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript. All of the popular server operating systems are supported, including Windows and Linux.[3]
Node.js applications are designed to maximize throughput and efficiency, using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous events. Node.js applications run single-threaded, although Node.js uses multiple threads for file and network events. Node.js is commonly used for real time applications due to its asynchronous nature, allowing applications to display information faster for users without the need for refreshing. 

### Grunt

Grunt automates checking your script files and provides you with a more advaced webserver capability. 

Install Grunt with a simple command in your shell

```
curl grunt.io

> Why use a task runner?
In one word: automation. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

### Bower


Install Bower wioth a command in your terminal 

```
curl bower
```

Wikipedia says: 

> Bower is a package management system for the World Wide Web. It depends on Node.js and npm. It works with git and GitHub repositories.
